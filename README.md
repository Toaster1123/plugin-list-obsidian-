# Plugin List Auto

Plugin List Auto is an Obsidian plugin that automatically generates and maintains a list of your installed plugins in a Markdown file of your choice.

It helps you keep track of your plugin setup, share it with others, and easily sync or back up your Obsidian environment across devices.

## Features

- Automatically generates a list of installed plugins
- Save the list to any Markdown file in your vault
- Choose the target file via plugin settings
- Updates the file only when needed (no constant polling)
- Works on both desktop and mobile

## Use Cases

- Share your plugin setup with other Obsidian users
- Keep a backup of your installed plugins
- Sync plugin lists between multiple devices
- Document and version-control your Obsidian environment

## How It Works

1. Install and enable the plugin
2. Open the plugin settings
3. Select or enter a Markdown file path
4. The plugin automatically writes your plugin list to that file

No templates, no manual copying — everything stays up to date automatically.
